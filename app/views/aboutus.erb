  <h5>Hi! I'm Anum Ahmad</h5>
    <p> My name is Anum.  I’m 14 years old and I love potatoes.  Fries, chips, mashed; I love them all.  I also love calligraphy and do digital art.  At my school, I am part of Science Olympiad, Model UN, and MIST.  I love to read and my favorite books are the Percy Jackson series.  I also enjoy solving Rubik’s Cubes and other puzzles.  I love coding and my favorite language is Ruby.  I attended the Philadelphia Kode With Klossy Camp in 2018 and I absolutely loved it!</p>

<h5>Hi! I'm Ellie Slawek</h5>

    <p> I'm 16 years old and I'm a 2018 Kode with Klossy Scholar in Philadelphia. This project was designed to make your day a little brighter, and I honestly couldn't be prouder of the outcome. Now, I'll tell you a little about me. I live right outside Philadelphia in a town called Conshohocken. If you ask anyone here at KWK, they’ll know that I do one thing and I talk about it way too much: robotics. I am on the longest continuously running all-girls team in FIRST. I get to work on our building side as a pit girl and on our business side doing waaaaay too many things. But one thing I haven’t been able to do is code. So KWK has allowed me to learn how to code and expand my knowledge on this amazing field. So you know a little bit about me, so now I hope you enjoy our website, because I know I enjoyed making it!</p>
